# Modelling and simulation of helio-crane

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and Simulink models developed for the modeling, analysis, optimization, and validation of a **helio-crane system** ‚Äî a laboratory model simulating a semi-helicopter mechanism.

The primary objectives of the project are:
- To build a robust **nonlinear mathematical model**,
- Optimize model parameters using experimental data,
- Analyze both static and dynamic characteristics,
- Derive **linearized models** around selected operating points,
- And validate the model using **real-world response data**.

## üß† Project Objectives

1. **Nonlinear Dynamic Modeling**  
   The helio-crane's dynamics were modeled using **Lagrange's equations**, incorporating:
   - Inertia
   - Damping
   - Gravity
   - External disturbances

2. **Static Characteristic Analysis**  
   Investigated the steady-state output vs. input voltage to identify:
   - Nonlinearities (e.g., dead zones)
   - Saturation zones

3. **Parameter Optimization**  
   Employed MATLAB‚Äôs `fminsearch` to minimize the error 

4. **Model Linearization**  
   Used MATLAB‚Äôs `linmod` to linearize the nonlinear model (`modelX2.slx`) at different operating points (e.g., DT = 5 and DT = 6).

5. **Validation with Random Excitations**  
   Final model evaluation was conducted using **random signal inputs**, comparing the model's output to the real device's response using:
   - **Sum of squared errors** (`J_kon`)
   - **Theil index** (forecast accuracy)

## ‚úÖ Running the Project

### 1. Generate Real System Data (Optional)

```matlab
zag; % Generates 'signali.mat'
```

### 2. Test Model on Random Inputs (Final Validation)

Before running, ensure the block in `vrednotenje.slx` is replaced with your model (e.g., `TekmaModel.slx`).

Then run:

```matlab
zag_vred;
```

## üìä Example Results

From the final evaluation (random signal testing), the model produced:

```
J_kon =
    2.6933

Theilov_indeks =
    0.0137
```

These values indicate **excellent model accuracy**:
- **J_kon** reflects the total squared error between real and simulated outputs.
- **Theil index** close to 0 implies strong predictive performance.
